# Starwars Catalog

This is a simple Vanilla JS application that request data about characters from Star Wars and displaying them in a UI that you create.

### Mockup

[Star Wars Catalog Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dTlnXYIYHgOL7Ikp65ga5Y/Star-Wars-Catalog?node-id=0%3A1)

This figma is just a base for you to get some inspiration. You are more than welcome to enhance it in your application, or come up with a different design, as long as the layout and structure is smilar.

**Design Requirements**

- There should be a hero-header that contains a nice image from Starwars and the name of the application.

- Two sections, both of which take up approximately 40-50%of the width of the page.

Try to make it as pretty as possible utilizing all your CSS skills.

#### The Star Wars Api - [swapi](https://swapi.dev)

**Feature Requirements**

- The left section of the application should containt a list of atleast six Star Wars characters. In the bottom of this section it should be navigation that you can click on to switch to another page where atleast six new characters will be displayed. Clicking on a character in the list should also make it switch to the character selected.

- The right section should be divided in to two. One of them should contain data about the character including: height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, species and gender. The other part should contain data about the character's home planet including: rotation period in hours, orbital period in days, diameter, climate, gravity, terrain and populations.

- When data is being fetched the UI should display som sort of loading animation in the corresponding section. If you are switching to a different character, the section on contating the data should have a loading animation for example. Here is a good site for getting loading animations: [css-loaders](https://css-loaders.com/).
